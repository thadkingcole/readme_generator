# Contributing Guidelines

First of all, I want to thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. Please refer to the following sections for the situation that best applies.

- [Bug](#if-you-find-a-bug)
- [Upgrade](#if-you-think-of-an-upgrade)
- [Questions](#i-have-a-question-on-how-to-use-the-app)
- [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)

## If you find a bug/upgrade

Awesome! First look at the issues to see if the bug/upgrade has already been identified. If not, create an issue describing the bug/upgrade with as much detail as possible, including steps to recreate.

If the bug/upgrade is unassigned, you may assign it to yourself and begin coding if you would like to try to fix the bug/upgrade. If the bug/upgrade is already assigned, touch base with that developer prior to beginning to code.
